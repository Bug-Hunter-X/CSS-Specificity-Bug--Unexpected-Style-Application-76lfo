The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

#myID div {
  color: green;
}

#myID .myClass div {
  color: purple;
}
```

The issue lies in the unexpected behavior when multiple selectors with varying specificity are applied to the same element.  In this example, a `<div>` element is targeted by four different rules. If an element has the class `myClass`, the `id myID`, and its parent is a `div`, the final color should be purple since the selector `#myID .myClass div` has the highest specificity. However, depending on the order of CSS declarations, unexpected behavior might arise due to specificity.
